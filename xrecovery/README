This is a custom recovery for Xperia X10 mini/pro based on Cyanogen's recovery source.

Requirements:
* Phone must be rooted
* Busybox from the market installed

Notes:
* Please bear in mind that it's not the regular android recovery (we cannot replace recovery image without cracked bootloader). Instead, the boot hijacking is used to start recovery mode. You still need basic files on your /system partition to use this. NEVER use the "format /system" option (it's there only to check if anyone reads this long, boring note).
* After installing xrecovery DO NOT reinstall busybox. Recovery depends on its particular busybox version.
